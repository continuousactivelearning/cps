#  Dependency-Aware Assessment Generator

A full-stack system that helps learners by understanding the **prerequisites** of a concept and generating a **custom quiz** based on their current knowledge level. Upload a **YouTube link**, **PDF**, or **image**, and the system intelligently derives the main topic, finds all prerequisite concepts, and generates quiz questions using those.
